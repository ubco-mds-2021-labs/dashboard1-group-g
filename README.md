- Your title can change over time.
- To determine what makes a song popular based on the attributes present in the data,track_popularity,danceability,energy,key,loudness,mode,speechiness,acousticness,instrumentalness,etc
- While the correlations between individual metrics and song popularity are quite small, how much of the variation in song popularity can be explained by these metrics if we use all of them as predictors in a linear regression?

We are all music enthusiasts and we have always been curious as to how a spotify algorithm works especially, what makes a song pop up on the 'most popular' list? What attributes of a song make it popular?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This [dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-01-21) was provided on Github as the January 21, 2020 [Tidy Tuesday challenge](https://|github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). As a result, this datset was provided with the purpose of learning how to wrangle and visualize data in R, and we are using it in a similar context to practice exploratory data analysis in Python. The data in the `csv` file were collected in January 2020 using the [`spotifyr`](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) R package, which connects to the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). The dataset contains information about around 30000 songs available on Spotify. This includes several variables identifying the song (id, name, artist, release date, album id, and album name), along with information about the playlist on which it was found (name, id, genre, and subgenre). Finally, it includes several numerical variables about the songs that we are mainly interested in analyzing (popularity, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and duration).
